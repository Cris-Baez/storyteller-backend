💡Note:

The 1.3B model is capable of generating videos at 720P resolution. However, due to limited training at this resolution, the results are generally less stable compared to 480P. For optimal performance, we recommend using 480P resolution.
For the first-last frame to video generation, we train our model primarily on Chinese text-video pairs. Therefore, we recommend using Chinese prompt to achieve better results.
Download models using huggingface-cli:

pip install "huggingface_hub[cli]"
huggingface-cli download Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-14B --local-dir ./Wan2.1-T2V-14B
Download models using modelscope-cli:

pip install modelscope
modelscope download Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-14B --local_dir ./Wan2.1-T2V-14B
Run Text-to-Video Generation
This repository supports two Text-to-Video models (1.3B and 14B) and two resolutions (480P and 720P). The parameters and configurations for these models are as follows:

Task	Resolution	Model
480P	720P
t2v-14B	✔️	✔️	Wan2.1-T2V-14B
t2v-1.3B	✔️	❌	Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B
(1) Without Prompt Extension
To facilitate implementation, we will start with a basic version of the inference process that skips the prompt extension step.

Single-GPU inference
python generate.py  --task t2v-14B --size 1280*720 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.1-T2V-14B --prompt "Two anthropomorphic cats in comfy boxing gear and bright gloves fight intensely on a spotlighted stage."
If you encounter OOM (Out-of-Memory) issues, you can use the --offload_model True and --t5_cpu options to reduce GPU memory usage. For example, on an RTX 4090 GPU:

python generate.py  --task t2v-1.3B --size 832*480 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B --offload_model True --t5_cpu --sample_shift 8 --sample_guide_scale 6 --prompt "Two anthropomorphic cats in comfy boxing gear and bright gloves fight intensely on a spotlighted stage."
💡Note: If you are using the T2V-1.3B model, we recommend setting the parameter --sample_guide_scale 6. The --sample_shift parameter can be adjusted within the range of 8 to 12 based on the performance.

Multi-GPU inference using FSDP + xDiT USP

We use FSDP and xDiT USP to accelerate inference.

Ulysess Strategy

If you want to use Ulysses strategy, you should set --ulysses_size $GPU_NUMS. Note that the num_heads should be divisible by ulysses_size if you wish to use Ulysess strategy. For the 1.3B model, the num_heads is 12 which can't be divided by 8 (as most multi-GPU machines have 8 GPUs). Therefore, it is recommended to use Ring Strategy instead.

Ring Strategy

If you want to use Ring strategy, you should set --ring_size $GPU_NUMS. Note that the sequence length should be divisible by ring_size when using the Ring strategy.

Of course, you can also combine the use of Ulysses and Ring strategies.

pip install "xfuser>=0.4.1"
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 generate.py --task t2v-14B --size 1280*720 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.1-T2V-14B --dit_fsdp --t5_fsdp --ulysses_size 8 --prompt "Two anthropomorphic cats in comfy boxing gear and bright gloves fight intensely on a spotlighted stage."
(2) Using Prompt Extension
Extending the prompts can effectively enrich the details in the generated videos, further enhancing the video quality. Therefore, we recommend enabling prompt extension. We provide the following two methods for prompt extension:

Use the Dashscope API for extension.
Apply for a dashscope.api_key in advance (EN | CN).
Configure the environment variable DASH_API_KEY to specify the Dashscope API key. For users of Alibaba Cloud's international site, you also need to set the environment variable DASH_API_URL to 'https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/api/v1'. For more detailed instructions, please refer to the dashscope document.
Use the qwen-plus model for text-to-video tasks and qwen-vl-max for image-to-video tasks.
You can modify the model used for extension with the parameter --prompt_extend_model. For example:
DASH_API_KEY=your_key python generate.py  --task t2v-14B --size 1280*720 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.1-T2V-14B --prompt "Two anthropomorphic cats in comfy boxing gear and bright gloves fight intensely on a spotlighted stage" --use_prompt_extend --prompt_extend_method 'dashscope' --prompt_extend_target_lang 'zh'
Using a local model for extension.

By default, the Qwen model on HuggingFace is used for this extension. Users can choose Qwen models or other models based on the available GPU memory size.
For text-to-video tasks, you can use models like Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct.
For image-to-video or first-last-frame-to-video tasks, you can use models like Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct.
Larger models generally provide better extension results but require more GPU memory.
You can modify the model used for extension with the parameter --prompt_extend_model , allowing you to specify either a local model path or a Hugging Face model. For example:
python generate.py  --task t2v-14B --size 1280*720 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.1-T2V-14B --prompt "Two anthropomorphic cats in comfy boxing gear and bright gloves fight intensely on a spotlighted stage" --use_prompt_extend --prompt_extend_method 'local_qwen' --prompt_extend_target_lang 'zh'
(3) Running with Diffusers
You can easily inference Wan2.1-T2V using Diffusers with the following command:

import torch
from diffusers.utils import export_to_video
from diffusers import AutoencoderKLWan, WanPipeline
from diffusers.schedulers.scheduling_unipc_multistep import UniPCMultistepScheduler

# Available models: Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-14B-Diffusers, Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B-Diffusers
model_id = "Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-14B-Diffusers"
vae = AutoencoderKLWan.from_pretrained(model_id, subfolder="vae", torch_dtype=torch.float32)
flow_shift = 5.0 # 5.0 for 720P, 3.0 for 480P
scheduler = UniPCMultistepScheduler(prediction_type='flow_prediction', use_flow_sigmas=True, num_train_timesteps=1000, flow_shift=flow_shift)
pipe = WanPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, vae=vae, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
pipe.scheduler = scheduler
pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "A cat and a dog baking a cake together in a kitchen. The cat is carefully measuring flour, while the dog is stirring the batter with a wooden spoon. The kitchen is cozy, with sunlight streaming through the window."
negative_prompt = "Bright tones, overexposed, static, blurred details, subtitles, style, works, paintings, images, static, overall gray, worst quality, low quality, JPEG compression residue, ugly, incomplete, extra fingers, poorly drawn hands, poorly drawn faces, deformed, disfigured, misshapen limbs, fused fingers, still picture, messy background, three legs, many people in the background, walking backwards"

output = pipe(
     prompt=prompt,
     negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
     height=720,
     width=1280,
     num_frames=81,
     guidance_scale=5.0,
    ).frames[0]
export_to_video(output, "output.mp4", fps=16)
💡Note: Please note that this example does not integrate Prompt Extension and distributed inference. We will soon update with the integrated prompt extension and multi-GPU version of Diffusers.

VACE	✔️	✔️	Wan2.1-VACE-14B
VACE	✔️	❌	Wan2.1-VACE-1.3B
In VACE, users can input text prompt and optional video, mask, and image for video generation or editing. Detailed instructions for using VACE can be found in the User Guide. The execution process is as follows:

(1) Preprocessing
User-collected materials needs to be preprocessed into VACE-recognizable inputs, including src_video, src_mask, src_ref_images, and prompt. For R2V (Reference-to-Video Generation), you may skip this preprocessing, but for V2V (Video-to-Video Editing) and MV2V (Masked Video-to-Video Editing) tasks, additional preprocessing is required to obtain video with conditions such as depth, pose or masked regions. For more details, please refer to vace_preproccess.

Manual Evaluation
(1) Text-to-Video Evaluation
Through manual evaluation, the results generated after prompt extension are superior to those from both closed-source and open-source models.


(2) Image-to-Video Evaluation
We also conducted extensive manual evaluations to evaluate the performance of the Image-to-Video model, and the results are presented in the table below. The results clearly indicate that Wan2.1 outperforms both closed-source and open-source models.


Computational Efficiency on Different GPUs
We test the computational efficiency of different Wan2.1 models on different GPUs in the following table. The results are presented in the format: Total time (s) / peak GPU memory (GB).


The parameter settings for the tests presented in this table are as follows: (1) For the 1.3B model on 8 GPUs, set --ring_size 8 and --ulysses_size 1; (2) For the 14B model on 1 GPU, use --offload_model True; (3) For the 1.3B model on a single 4090 GPU, set --offload_model True --t5_cpu; (4) For all testings, no prompt extension was applied, meaning --use_prompt_extend was not enabled.

💡Note: T2V-14B is slower than I2V-14B because the former samples 50 steps while the latter uses 40 steps.

Introduction of Wan2.1
Wan2.1 is designed on the mainstream diffusion transformer paradigm, achieving significant advancements in generative capabilities through a series of innovations. These include our novel spatio-temporal variational autoencoder (VAE), scalable training strategies, large-scale data construction, and automated evaluation metrics. Collectively, these contributions enhance the model’s performance and versatility.

(1) 3D Variational Autoencoders
We propose a novel 3D causal VAE architecture, termed Wan-VAE specifically designed for video generation. By combining multiple strategies, we improve spatio-temporal compression, reduce memory usage, and ensure temporal causality. Wan-VAE demonstrates significant advantages in performance efficiency compared to other open-source VAEs. Furthermore, our Wan-VAE can encode and decode unlimited-length 1080P videos without losing historical temporal information, making it particularly well-suited for video generation tasks.


(2) Video Diffusion DiT
Wan2.1 is designed using the Flow Matching framework within the paradigm of mainstream Diffusion Transformers. Our model's architecture uses the T5 Encoder to encode multilingual text input, with cross-attention in each transformer block embedding the text into the model structure. Additionally, we employ an MLP with a Linear layer and a SiLU layer to process the input time embeddings and predict six modulation parameters individually. This MLP is shared across all transformer blocks, with each block learning a distinct set of biases. Our experimental findings reveal a significant performance improvement with this approach at the same parameter scale.


Model	Dimension	Input Dimension	Output Dimension	Feedforward Dimension	Frequency Dimension	Number of Heads	Number of Layers
1.3B	1536	16	16	8960	256	12	30
14B	5120	16	16	13824	256	40	40
Data
We curated and deduplicated a candidate dataset comprising a vast amount of image and video data. During the data curation process, we designed a four-step data cleaning process, focusing on fundamental dimensions, visual quality and motion quality. Through the robust data processing pipeline, we can easily obtain high-quality, diverse, and large-scale training sets of images and videos.

Comparisons to SOTA
We compared Wan2.1 with leading open-source and closed-source models to evaluate the performance. Using our carefully designed set of 1,035 internal prompts, we tested across 14 major dimensions and 26 sub-dimensions. We then compute the total score by performing a weighted calculation on the scores of each dimension, utilizing weights derived from human preferences in the matching process. The detailed results are shown in the table below. These results demonstrate our model's superior performance compared to both open-source and closed-source models.

minimax / hailuo-02

More by this author
Hailuo 2 is a text-to-video and image-to-video model that can make 6s or 10s videos at 720p (standard) or 1080p (pro). It excels at real world physics.

const input = {
  prompt: "a dog speed climbs up a climbing wall at the olympics",
  duration: 6,
  resolution: "1080p",
  prompt_optimizer: false
};

const output = await replicate.run("minimax/hailuo-02", { input });
